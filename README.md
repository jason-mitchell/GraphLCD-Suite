# GraphLCD-Suite
The Windows based Font Management Utility for GraphLCD

EasyGUI remains as expensive as ever, and there are no other tools available which are open source, or are of
any quality to rival EasyGUI. Until now. This is the font creation/management frontend for a project I have created
in 2008 to manage fonts I used in my embedded graphics LCD driver library.

Eventually this tool will be able to import existing EasyGUI projects aswell
